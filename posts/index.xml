      <description>Deep Learning is becoming one of most important approach for many of the difficult task especially in computer vision. Starting from Imagenet, Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to solve many complex problems such as object detection, semantic segmentation and many more. Most of the recent research papers are focused on applications that are related to human, household objects, animals or similar object related task. Despite immense advances, dataset dependency of the solutions limits the generizability of a solution as different application brings their own set of challenges.</description>
